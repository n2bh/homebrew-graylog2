graylog2
========

This repository is a [homebrew](http://google.com) tap designed to ease the pain
of installing and configuring Graylog2 for local installation.

These forumlae include graylog2, the graylog2 web interface and logstash.
Logstash is used to read archived log4j logs from disk and transport them to
Graylog2 for analysis.
